            <p class="lead">I’m a former Business Analyst with 5+ years working within Product Delivery teams and delivering on project deliverables along Agile methodology.

After a fruitful career as a Business Analyst, I decided to transition toward a career as a Software Engineer.

I’m currently completing Flatiron School’s Full-Time Software Engineering Bootcamp. I’ve completed over 45+ hours a week of study time and completed 4 group projects, developing full-stack applications, utilizing my knowledge of JavaScript, React, SQL, and Ruby. 

I’m a creative person at heart- ask me about improv comedy!- which is what led me to change my career from “facilitator of technology” to “creator of technology.”

I strongly believe that my years of experience working as a Business Analyst enhanced with my new found skills in Programming would make me an incredible asset to any team.</p>
