            <p class="lead">I’m a former Business Analyst with 5+ years working within Product Delivery teams and delivering on project deliverables along Agile methodology. After a fruitful career as a Business Analyst, I decided to transition toward a career as a Software Engineer.</p>

            <p class="lead">

            A recent graduate of Flatiron School’s Full-Time Software Engineering Bootcamp, I’ve completed over 45+ hours a week of study time and completed 4 group projects, developing full-stack applications, utilizing my knowledge of JavaScript, React, SQL, and Ruby. I’m a creative person at heart- ask me about improv comedy!- which is what led me to change my career from “facilitator of technology” to “creator of technology.”
            </p>
            <p class="lead">I strongly believe that my years of experience working as a Business Analyst enhanced with my new found skills in Programming would make me an incredible asset to any team.</p>
